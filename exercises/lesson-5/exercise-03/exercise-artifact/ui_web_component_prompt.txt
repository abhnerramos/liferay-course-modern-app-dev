I have a simple but working React 18.3.1 app created with Vite and Yarn, and 
all dependencies are properly declared and available, including the yarn setup.
The app has an input field where the user types a name, a Greet button, and 
below that it displays “Hello <name>” after clicking the button. 
The App.jsx file defines the App component which implements the bulk of the 
application, and the main.jsx file is responsible for rendering the App.
I want to convert this app into a standard web component that I can use on any 
HTML page.
Please show me how to:
	1.	Update the vite.config.js to build the app as a standard web component.
	2.	Modify the main.jsx file to define and register a custom element that 
	    uses the App component. Don't forget to include the logic for the 
	    disconnect to clean up properly.
	3.	Update or replace index.html so I can test the web component directly.
I’m using React 18.3.1 (explicitly), Vite, and Yarn.
I don’t need perfect styling or structure — just make the simplest working 
version that can mount as a web component and work the same way. Also I want 
to build it as a module in ESM format, and I'd like the custom tag to be 
greet-ui.
Please include all file changes and any commands I need to run.
